## Fourier Sensitivity and Regularization of Computer Vision

Official code repository for the paper "Fourier Sensitivity and Regularization of Computer Vision".

Fourier Sensitivity of computer vision models is based on a rigorously defined measure of sensitivity to input frequencies.
Please see the paper for details.

## Installing libraries
The code was run with Python3.8

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Generating Fourier Sensitivity Plots
Please see the jupyter notebook "Fourier-Sensitivity.ipynb" for examples of plotting the Fourier Sensitivity of pre-trained models. 
Run all cells to re-generate the plots (be sure to change the path to the dataset variable, i.e., PATH\_TO\_IMAGENET)
